The data I am using comes from the World Bank Data Catalog. The dataset is the Social Accounting Matrix for Russia for the year of 1995 (the only one available on the website). I introduce a single and multiple negative shocks to import taxes on agricultural commodities and positive shocks on labor and/or capital. My baseline model assumes free trade for the agricultural sector with zero import tariffs. The model is then shocked to reflect implications of various policy decisions.
